The goal of this project is to use machine learning to solve a problem that arises in Information Retrieval, one known as the Learning to rank (LeToR) problem. 

1. Here, the linear regression model is trained on LeToR dataset and synthetic dataset using closed form solution and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
2. The project description is also attached in this repository, which gives a detailed explanation on the equations used for generating Linear Regression algorithms that is implemented in the main.py file.
3. the data is divided into training and testing sets and separated functions are written for closed form, stochastic gradient and regularized closed form and regularized stochastic gradient descent solutions. 
4. Values of M and eta are taken based on intuition and detailed analysis of each value of hyperparamter and the corresponding Root Mean Square value is given in proj2.pdf.
5. ERMS value is obtained to be optimal when eta is 0.5 and M is 4.
