This project concerns probability distributions and bayesian network construction.

1. Mean, variance and standard distribution are calculated for each variable in university data.xlsx.
2. For each pair of variables, covariane and correlation is calculated plotted.
3. Log-likelihood of data is determined assuming that each variable is normally distributed and that they are independeent of each other
4. Bayesian network is constructed based on these correlation values. It resuted in higher log-likelihood than that in the previous step.
